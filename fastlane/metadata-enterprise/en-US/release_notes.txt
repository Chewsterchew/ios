Images from external services are now displayed inline if you turn on "Embed external media" in Display Options. You can change the default behaviour everywhere from the Settings screen. These settings will match your preferences in the web/desktop client.

You can also now format your messages with bold, italics, underline, and colors. Select the message text you want to format then use the edit menu buttons. You can even paste preformatted text copied from elsewhere. `code spans`, ```code blocks```, and > quoted messages work too.
